Website of my local car repair shop

Current website of my local car repair shop https://www.carrepair-berlin.de/index.php
I would like to redesign the whole website, to have the first bigger project in my portfolio.

Found few designs online. Will chose one of them and implement it with my own tweaks.
Will keep this file updated.

For this project I'll use only HTML, CSS and maybe add some vanilla JS.
I do start with mobile first and afterwards I'll apply the changes to the normal size also.
